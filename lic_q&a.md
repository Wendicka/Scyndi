# A few questions regarding the license

## Scyndi has been released under the GNU GPL. This is a viral license. Does that mean the code I translate/compile through Scyndi is GPL as well?

- No! The GPL only applies to the source code of the translator itself. The code you write yourself counts as the data it processes, as well as the code generated through translation. If you use a GPL licensed picture converter to convert a JPEG picture into PNG that neither the PNG picture, nor the original JPEG file become GPL either, do they?
- One trapdoor must be taken in order. If you "merge" either your original Scyndi code or the translated code with libraries released under a GPL license the "viral" effect can still apply! The license Scyndi itself has, has no effect on that one.

## So that means that Scyndi may be used to code closed-sourced-commericial software?

- Yup! 

## What is the license of the default libraries/modules/units provided with Scyndi?

- Most of them will likely be licensed under a zLib license. MPL or MIT is also possible. Viral licenses (such as GPL) are not very likely for these. 

## Why GPL for Scyndi itself?

- Because I wanted the language itself to be free (as in freedom).

## Are the name "Scyndi" and the "Logo" falling under this license?

- Yes and no.... "Scyndi" has been named after a fictional girl named "Scyndi Scorpio" (hence the name "Scorpion" for the cli translation tool), from the Phantasar Chronicles. A fantasy saga of which I own the copyrights (since I've written those myself). The picture I use as a kind of "logo" for Scyndi depicts her, but does belong to the Phantasar Chronicles which has an "all rights reserved" license. I will however not mind the picture or the name being used in the context of the language, however if you are creating a new language based on Scyndi, you will need to discuss the usage of the logo and the name with me first. If you just created a "better compiler" which is faster or creates more efficient code in translation, it will mostly not be that much of a problem (as long as I am given proper credit for the original language, the name "Scyndi", and as long as you note that the picture (created by Man of Steel) belongs to me. If you create a "dialect" or even a complete new language inspired on Scyndi a new name (and logo) will very likely be in order.

## Do I need your permission to make syntax highlighting scripts for known IDEs?

- Of course not! Go a head, create them. Please do! Only saves me work :P

## So I am allowed to make my own Scyndi compiler?

- Yes. Please note though, that for the time being I decide what is "Official Scyndi Language" though. I do want to have that one clear when incompatibilities between the original Scyndi and your compiler pop up. Please take note of the conditions on which the name "Scyndi" and the image of the girl Scyndi may be used.

## I would like to make Scorpion translate to a language that is currently not supported. May I had support for that?

- Yes... That's why I released it in the open source in the first place. As long as the conditions of the GPL are met. ;)

## Can I make a commerical Scyndi compiler?

- Rather not, but I am willing to talk about that option.
- The commercial compiler may NOT carry the name Scyndi nor use my logo without my prior written permission, though.
- The commercial compiler should provide information about it being based on Scyndi and being created by me in its documentation.

## Can I make a special Scyndi IDE, being able to call Scorpion accordingly?

- Why not?

## Can I make a commericial Scyndi IDE, being able to call Scorpion accordingly, and Scorpion being provided with that IDE?

- Short answer: yes
- Long answer: The GPL does allow software licensed under it to be included in sold packages, but the software is and will remain GPL licensed, meaning you need to respect that license, and that Scorpion will thus remain free (as in freedom) and may still be distributed as such separately from your IDE. If your IDE provides a MODIFIED version of Scorpion, the modified source code must remain freely attainable, as is a condition of the GPL.
